# Bot-Chassis-with-Autodesk-Fusion-360-
This repository showcases my journey in designing a robot chassis using Autodesk Fusion 360. This hands-on project integrates mechanical design, sensor placement, and component alignment to create a functional and efficient robotic system.
ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights
3D Modeling: Designed a modular bot chassis capable of housing multiple components.
Sensor Integration: Accommodates IR and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and navigation.
Mechanical Efficiency: Optimized for smooth movement with a robust frame.
Prototyping-Friendly: Includes space for breadboard circuit testing and easy assembly.
ðŸ”§ Key Components
The bot chassis is designed to incorporate:

IR Sensors â€“ For obstacle detection and line-following capabilities.
Ultrasonic Sensors â€“ Ensures accurate distance measurement.
Servo Motors â€“ Enables precise movement and steering control.
Wheels â€“ Provides smooth and efficient mobility.
Breadboard â€“ Facilitates quick prototyping and circuit integration.

3D Printing:
Use the .stl files in the design_files/ folder to 3D print the chassis components.

ðŸš€ Future Plans
Design additional modular attachments for sensors and tools.
Experiment with lightweight materials to optimize mobility.
Create a fully autonomous robot using this chassis as the base.
